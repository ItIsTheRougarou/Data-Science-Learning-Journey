                <p>Hi everyone,</p>
                <p>My name is Gildas, and I'm 37 y.o. (nearly 38, I know, I know...), and I've decided to definitelu switch careers, from being a client advisor to become a data scientist, and I'm also learning web development, to improve my coding skills and get used to use development tools ans frameworks.</p>
                <p>Computers have always been my passion, but I've never been able to really put myself to study Computer Science.  Sometimes because of a lack of money, sometimes because of a lack of self-conidence,... Pretty much everything that someone says to himself, when he wants to postpone something, believe me!</p>
                <p>Starting from scratch, the range of things that I wanted to study was huge. Really huge. But I've quickly found out that studying everything was nigh impossible, so I've decided to rethink my project, searching the answer to the question: "What is the thing, in Computer Science, that interests you the most?</p>
                <p>Though web development is an interesting field, with plenty of jobs and a huge community, my nature is more the one of a researcher, an analyst than the one of a designer, so I've opted for data science, where I'll have to mine data and analyse things every day.</p><br>

                <p>Here are the three things that I love to do, when I'm not working or learning:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Reading fiction books</li>
                    <li>Walking around my city</li>
                    <li>Cooking some awesome meals...</li>
                </ul>
                <p>And here are the top three things I like the most in Computer Science:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Knowing how everything works behind the scenes</li>
                    <li>Analyzing data and how this data could be used</li>
                    <li>Constantly having to learn new things</li>
                </ol><br>
