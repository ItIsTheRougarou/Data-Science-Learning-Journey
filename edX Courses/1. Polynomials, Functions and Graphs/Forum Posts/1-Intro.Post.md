# Introduction Post

## Hello everyone

I am Gildas, from France, and I'm on my way to switch careers, in order to work in a field that interests me for a long time, now, data science. I'm taking this course because I think I need to review the basics of mathematics, before diving into more complex concepts. Have fun learning!
